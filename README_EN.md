## Host Playify Yourself

Want to run Playify on your own machine? Hereâ€™s how:

### Requirements

1. **Python 3.9 or later** must be installed. You can get it here: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **FFmpeg** must be installed and added to your system PATH. Follow this [guide](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) for installation.
3. A Discord bot token (available from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)).
4. Install the required dependencies using `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alan7383/playify.git
   cd playify
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file to store your Discord token **(optional but recommended)**:
   ```env
   DISCORD_TOKEN=Your_Discord_Token
   ```
   *Never share your Discord token publicly!*

4. **Extra option**: If you donâ€™t like using the terminal, just double-click `lancer_bot.bat` to launch the bot instantly.

5. Start the bot:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   *If you're on a Unix-based system (Linux/Mac), use `python3 main.py`.*

### Additional Notes

- Make sure the bot has the necessary permissions to join voice channels and send messages.
- If you run into issues, check the logs in the console for more details.
