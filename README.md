Playify is a Discord music bot. It plays music. That's it.

No web UI. No “premium tier”. No bloat. Just clean commands and proper sound.

No limits whatsoever — whether it’s the number of tracks in a playlist or anything else.

You type play, it plays. You type stop, it stops. Revolutionary.

## 🧪 Spotify Support (Beta)

Yes, it plays Spotify tracks now. Kind of.

- ✅ Individual tracks? Works fine.
- 🔁 Small playlists? Sure.
- 🪦 Giant playlists? Come back later.

---

## ✨ Features

- Music from YouTube, SoundCloud, and Spotify
- Commands you already know: `play`, `pause`, `skip`, etc.
- Custom playlists (stored locally)
- Actually fast — no stupid queue lag
- Built with `yt-dlp`, `FFmpeg`, `asyncio` and pure resentment

---

## 💻 Self-hosting?

Yeah, you can.

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- FFmpeg
- A Discord bot token
- Spotify API creds (if you care)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alan7383/playify.git
cd playify
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Create a `.env` file:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

And run it:

```bash
python main.py
```

Done. No PhD required.

## 🛰️ Don’t want to self-host?

Bot is already running 24/7.

You can just invite it:

👉 [Add to Discord](https://alan7383.github.io/playify/)

## 🧠 Will you see what I’m playing?

Nah, your music taste is safe.

Playify doesn’t log a thing. Not out of some noble privacy crusade, but because debugging is a pain asf. If something breaks, I just shrug and keep vibing. Probably.

## 🛠 Contribute?

You can fork, PR, whatever.
But don’t expect a quick merge unless it fixes something annoying.

## ❤️ Support

Wanna support the chaos?

👉 [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/alanmussot1)

It helps keep it ad-free. And maybe I’ll fix bugs faster. Maybe.
