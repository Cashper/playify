## ＼(ノºДº)ノ What is Playify?

Playify is a minimalist Discord music bot.

- No web UI.
- No premium tier.
- No bloat.

Just clean commands and proper sound.  
You type `play`, it plays. You type `stop`, it stops. Revolutionary.

**No limits whatsoever — whether it’s the number of tracks in a playlist or anything else. Spotify support is fully functional (with one small caveat).**

---

## (＾□＾) Spotify Support

Yes, it plays Spotify tracks. Fully.

- ✅ Individual tracks? Works fine.  
- ✅ Small or giant playlists? Absolutely.  
- ⚠️ **Playlists created by Spotify (e.g. "This Is", "Your Mix", "Release Radar") are not supported — blame the API.**

---

## (｡‿‿｡) Features

- Music from YouTube, SoundCloud, and Spotify  
- Commands you already know: `play`, `pause`, `skip`, etc.  
- Custom playlists (stored locally)  
- Actually fast — no stupid queue lag  
- Built with `yt-dlp`, `FFmpeg`, `asyncio` and pure resentment

---

## (◕‿◕)ノ Self-hosting?

Yeah, you can.

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+  
- FFmpeg  
- A Discord bot token  
- Spotify API creds (if you care)

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alan7383/playify.git
cd playify
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

Create a `.env` file:

```env
DISCORD_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

And run it:

```bash
python main.py
```

Done. No PhD required.

## (´・ω・\`)ノ Don’t want to self-host?

Bot is already running 24/7.
You can just invite it:

👉 [Add to Discord](https://alan7383.github.io/playify/)

## (・Д・)ノ♥ Your privacy, your music.

**Will you see what I’m playing?**
Nope. Your music taste stays between you and your headphones.

**Playify doesn’t store or collect any user data.**
It logs basic playback stuff *locally* to help with debugging — and that’s it.
No tracking, no history, no analytics.
**Nothing leaves your machine. Ever.**

If something breaks, I check the console.
If it works, we vibe.
If it doesn’t, enjoy the silence (or not).

## (≧□≦)ノ Contribute?

You can fork, PR, whatever.
But don’t expect a quick merge unless it fixes something annoying.

## (･∀･)♡ Support

Wanna support the chaos?

👉 [Paypal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/alanmussot1)

It helps keep it ad-free. And maybe I’ll fix bugs faster. Maybe.
